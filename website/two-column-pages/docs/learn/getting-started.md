# Getting Started

## Download the Ballerina distribution

You can download the Ballerina distribution from [download page](https://ballerina.io/downloads/) for your operating system.

If a binary distribution is not available for your combination of operating system and architecture, try [installing from source](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang#install-from-source).

### System requirements

Ballerina binary distributions are available for the following supported operating systems and architectures. Ensure that your system meets the requirements before you proceed with the installation.

- Windows Vista SP2 x64 or later
- Ubuntu Linux 12.04 x64 - LTS and above
- Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2 and above
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 x64 and above
- OS X 10.8.3 x64 and above

If your operating system or architecture is not on the list, you can [install from source](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/blob/master/README.md#install-from-source) instead.

## Installing Ballerina via installers

If you are upgrading to the latest version of Ballerina from an older version, you can download the latest version and run it without uninstalling the old version. 
If you are building from source, you must update the path with the new version of Ballerina.

### Installing on OS X

[Download the package file](/downloads) and double-click on it to launch the installer. The installer guides you through the installation process and installs the Ballerina distribution to `/Library/Ballerina`.

The package automatically sets your PATH environment variable for you. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

### Installing on Windows

[Download the MSI file](/downloads) and double-click on it to launch the installer. The installer guides you through the installation process and installs the Ballerina distribution to `C:\Program Files\Ballerina\`.

The installer should put the `C:\Program Files\Ballerina\<ballerina-directory>\bin` directory in your PATH environment variable. You may have to restart any open command prompts for the change to take effect.

### Installing on Linux

[Download the DEB file or RPM file](/downloads), open it, and follow the instructions below to install Ballerina:

* If you downloaded the DEB file, use the following command, and specify the actual filename and location in the command:

```
dpkg -i /<ballerina-home>/<ballerina-binary>.deb
```
This installs the Ballerina distribution to `/usr/lib/ballerina`.

* If you downloaded the RPM file, use the following command, and specify the actual filename and location in the command:

```
rpm -i <ballerina-binary>.rpm
```
This installs the Ballerina distribution to `/usr/lib64/ballerina`.

## Installing via the Ballerina language ZIP file

> **Note**: Before you install Ballerina using the ZIP file, ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8 installed.

[Download the Ballerina language ZIP file](/downloads) and unzip it to a preferred location using an archiver tool of your choice. This creates a directory named `ballerina-language-<version>` in your system. 

Follow one of the steps below depending on your operating system to configure your system environment to run Ballerina:

* If your operating system is Linux or Mac OS, set the PATH environment variable to point to the bin directory of the unzipped Ballerina distribution.
* If your operating system is Windows, add a new environment variable specifying the following values:
  * Variable name: PATH
  * Variable value: The location of the bin directory of the unzipped Ballerina distribution. For example,  c:/Program Files/Ballerina/ballerina-language-<version>/bin
  
## Uninstalling Ballerina

To remove an existing Ballerina installation, go to the Ballerina installation location and delete the Ballerina directory.

> **Note**:
> * If you installed Ballerina via an installer, the installation location is usually `/Library/Ballerina` in Mac OS X, `/usr/lib/ballerina/` in Ubuntu, `/usr/lib64/ballerina` in CentOS, and `C:\Program Files\Ballerina\` in Windows.

> * If you installed Ballerina using the Ballerina language ZIP file, be sure to remove the Ballerina PATH environment variable that you set in your system environment.
