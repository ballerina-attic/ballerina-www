## Installing Ballerina

If you are upgrading from an older version of Ballerina, you can simply download the newer version and run it without uninstalling the older version. If you are building from source, you must update the path for the new version of Ballerina.

### Installing on OS X

[Download the package file](/downloads), open it, and follow the prompts to install Ballerina. The package installs the Ballerina distribution to `/Library/Ballerina`.

The package automatically sets your PATH environment variable for you. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

Alternatively, if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your Mac, you can install the Ballerina package with:

```
brew install ballerina
```

### Installing on Windows

[Download the MSI file](/downloads), open it, and follow the prompts to install Ballerina. By default, the installer puts the Ballerina distribution in `C:\Program Files\Ballerina\`.

The installer should put the `C:\Program Files\Ballerina\<ballerina-directory>\bin` directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open command prompts for the change to take effect.

### Installing on Linux

[Download the DEB file or RPM file](/downloads), open it, and follow the prompts to install Ballerina.

You can install the DEB file using the following command. You need to specify the actual filename and location in the command.

```
dpkg -i /<ballerina-home>/<ballerina-binary>.deb
```

You can install the RPM file using the following command. You need to specify the actual filename and location in the command.

```
rpm -i <ballerina-binary>.rpm
```

## Uninstalling Ballerina

To remove an existing Ballerina installation, delete the Ballerina directory. This is usually `/usr/local/ballerina` under Linux and Mac OS X, and `C:\Ballerina` under Windows.

You should also remove the Ballerina bin directory from your PATH environment variable.
