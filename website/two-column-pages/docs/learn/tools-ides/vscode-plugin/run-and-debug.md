# Run and debug

The VS Code Ballerina extension gives you the  same debugging experience as the conventional VS Code Debugger. Therefore, you can run or debug your Ballerina programs easily via the VS Code Ballerina extension by launching its debugger. 

Follow the steps below to start a 
debug session. 

1. Click the **Debug** icon in the left menu or press the **Control + Shift + D** keys, to launch the Debugger view.
2. Add the debug points you require by clicking on the respective line numbers of the file.
3. Click **No Configurations** and select **Add Configuration...**. 
4. Click **Ballerina Debug**. This opens the *launch.json* file. You can edit this file to change the debug configuration options as required.
5. Click on the name of the file that you want to debug.
6. Click the **Start Debugging** icon.

You view the output in the **DEBUG CONSOLE**.
