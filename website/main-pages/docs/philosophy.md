                    <p>Cloud-native and microservices architectures enable enterprises to have trillions of programmable network endpoints, making integration the glue that brings APIs, microservices, and data together as a whole. Centralized and configuration-driven approaches to integration, with ESBs, are not agile or cloud-native.

            <p>Ballerina represents clients, workers, and remote systems as different actors in the sequence diagram. In code, remote endpoints are interfaced via connectors, which offer type-safe actions. Graphically, each connector is represented as an actor in the sequence diagram (i.e., a vertical line) and actions are represented as interactions with those actors.</p>

            <h3>WORKER SEMANTICS</h3>

            <h3>TYPE SAFETY</h3>
            <p>Ballerina has a structural type system with primitive, record, object, tuple, and union types. This type-safe model incorporates type inference at assignment and provides numerous compile time integrity checks for connectors, logic, and network-bound payloads.  </p>

            <h3>UNION TYPES AND EXPLICIT NULLS</h3>
            <p>Individual network endpoints often return messages with different payload types and errors, depending on their inputs and logic. Ballerina’s type system embraces this variability with an approach based on union types. Union types explicitly capture this semantics without requiring developers to create unnecessary “wrapper” types. This approach also enhances the handling of null values. By default, types do not support null values. Developers must explicitly create union types to handle nulls. The result is that null exceptions cannot happen and the language syntax and compiler identifies whether null handling logic is required or not.</p>

            <p>The Ballerina type system has rich built in support for JSON, XML, streams and tables, as well as direct support for ProtoBuf and gRPC. The result is clean, readable code for dealing with network payloads, SQL programming and stream processing. Data transformation logic isn’t encumbered with complex generated types, third-party library code or other obfuscation - simple clear readable code captures interactions with heterogenous data and transformation logic.</p>

            <h3>OPINIONATED TOOLCHAIN</h3>
            <p>Over the past 15 years, best practices and expectations on the associated toolset that a language provides have evolved. Now, a language is not ready for adoption unless it includes a unit test framework, build system, documentation generation, dependency management and versioning, and a way to share modules of reusable code. Ballerina includes all of these subsystems as part of its core distribution so that there is no risk of community drift, which is what happens when the ecosystem needs to build tools on top of a language instead of designing it within the language. </p>

            <h3>PACKAGE MANAGEMENT</h3>
            <p>Ballerina’s package management, dependency and versioning model is based on learnings from Docker, Elm, and NPM. While it is possible to build and run individual Ballerina source files, packages (modules) can only be built as part of a project, which is managed by Ballerina. Every project has its own dependency cache and all packages are versioned according to semver rules. Strict rules limit dependency conflicts from applications that import packages from a central registry. Packages can be pushed to Ballerina Central and shared with the other users.</p>

By having the language and build system be environmentally aware of other components surrounding our service, we can generate essential artifact code ahead of CI/CD, perform data and integrity checks around network-bound payloads, and pre-package dependent but not yet deployed components as part of the Ballerina binary.</p>

                    <p>Ballerina is a language designed to be <em>integration simple</em>. Based around the interactions of sequence diagrams, Ballerina has built-in support for common integration patterns and connectors, including distributed transactions,
                        compensation and circuit breakers. With first-class support for JSON and XML, Ballerina makes it simple and effective to build robust integration across network endpoints.</p>
