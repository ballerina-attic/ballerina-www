                    <h3>TYPE SAFETY</h3>
                    <p>Ballerina has a structural type system with primitive, record, object, tuple, and union types. This type-safe model incorporates type inference at assignment and provides numerous compile time integrity checks for connectors, logic, and network-bound payloads.  </p>

                    <h3>UNION TYPES AND EXPLICIT NULLS</h3>
                    <p>Individual network endpoints often return messages with different payload types and errors, depending on their inputs and logic. Ballerina’s type system embraces this variability with an approach based on union types. Union types explicitly capture this semantics without requiring developers to create unnecessary “wrapper” types. This approach also enhances the handling of null values. By default, types do not support null values. Developers must explicitly create union types to handle nulls. The result is that null exceptions cannot happen and the language syntax and compiler identifies whether null handling logic is required or not.</p>

                    <p>The Ballerina type system has rich built in support for JSON, XML, streams and tables, as well as direct support for ProtoBuf and gRPC. The result is clean, readable code for dealing with network payloads, SQL programming and stream processing. Data transformation logic isn’t encumbered with complex generated types, third-party library code or other obfuscation - simple clear readable code captures interactions with heterogenous data and transformation logic.</p>

                    <p>Ballerina contains observability features and provides monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing. This enables language features such as services, functions, and streams to be observed by default, without writing explicit user code.

                        Asynchronous calls to functions and endpoints create a future&lt;type&gt; variable that can then be passed further to other calls is needed. Once the actual value is needed, the wait operator can be used to wait for the actual return.

                        Ballerina compiler is extensible with packages. This particular example is using the Kubernetes package to generate Kubernetes artifacts and docker image. Other platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Mesos, and so on can have their own packages, annotations, and artifact generation.
