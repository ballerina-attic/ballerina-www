<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external
outputs. Monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing are key methods that reveal the internal state of the system to
provide the observability. Ballerina becomes fully observable by exposing itself via these three methods to various 
external systems allowing to monitor metrics such as request count and response time statistics, analyze logs, and
perform distributed tracing. </p>
<p>HTTP/HTTPS based Ballerina services and any client connectors are observable by default. HTTP/HTTPS and SQL client
connectors use semantic tags to make tracing and metrics monitoring more informative.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>This section focuses on enabling Ballerina service observability with some of its default supported systems.
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> are used for metrics monitoring, and <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a> is used for distributed tracing. 
Ballerina logs can be fed to any external log monitoring system like <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic Stack</a> to perform log monitoring and 
analysis.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Make sure you have already installed <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to setup external products such as Jaeger,
Prometheus, etc. You can follow <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">official documentation</a> to install Docker.</p>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install and configure Prometheus, Grafana, Jeager and Elastic Stack to Observe Ballerina. </p>
<ul>
<li>Setup Prometheus for collecting metrics information by following section on <a href="#prometheus">Setting up Prometheus</a></li>
<li>Setup Grafana to visualize metrics by following section on <a href="#grafana">Setting up Grafana</a></li>
<li>Setup Jaeger analyze tracing as mentioned in section <a href="#jaeger-server">Setting up Jaeger</a></li>
<li>Setup Elastic Stack only if you are interested in analysing logs by following section on <a href="#elastic-stack">Setting up Elastic Stack</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create Hello World Ballerina service.</p>
<p>Create a Service as shown below and save it as <code>hello_world_service.bal</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="ballerina">import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/log;

service hello on new http:Listener(9090) {

    resource function sayHello (http:Caller caller, http:Request req) returns error? {
        log:printInfo(&quot;This is a test Info log&quot;);
        log:printError(&quot;This is a test Error log&quot;);
        log:printWarn(&quot;This is a test Warn log&quot;);
        http:Response res = new;
        res.setPayload(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
        check caller-&gt;respond(res);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Observe Hello World Ballerina service</p>
<p>Observability is disabled by default and can be enabled by using the <code>--b7a.observability.enabled=true</code> flag or updating the configurations.</p>
<p>When Ballerina observability is enabled, Ballerina runtime exposes internal metrics via an HTTP endpoint for metrics
monitoring and tracers will be published to Jaeger. Prometheus should be configured to scrape metrics from
the metrics HTTP endpoint in Ballerina.</p>
<p>Ballerina logs are logged on to the console. Therefore, the logs need to be redirected to a file, which can then be
pushed to <a href="#Distributed-Logging">Elastic Stack</a> to perform the log analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Start the service using <code>--b7a.observability.enabled=true</code> flag:</strong></p>
<p>The Ballerina service is observable with default settings when the <code>--b7a.observability.enabled=true</code> flag is used along with the Ballerina
<code>run</code> command to start the service.
This lets you to collect the distributed tracing information with Jaeger and metrics information with Prometheus.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ ballerina run hello_world_service.bal --b7a.observability.enabled=true

[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9797
ballerina: started Prometheus HTTP listener 0.0.0.0:9797
ballerina: started publishing tracers to Jaeger on localhost:5775
[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9090
</code></pre>

<p>Redirect the standard output to a file if you want to monitor logs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ nohup ballerina run hello_world_service.bal --b7a.observability.enabled=true &gt; ballerina.log &amp;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Start the service using a configuration file:</strong></p>
<p>Observability of Ballerina service can also be enabled from the configuration. Create a configuration file such as 
<code>ballerina.conf</code> and add the below configuration that starts metrics monitoring and distributed tracing with default 
settings.</p>
<pre><code class="toml">[b7a.observability.metrics]
# Flag to enable Metrics
enabled=true

[b7a.observability.tracing]
# Flag to enable Tracing
enabled=true
</code></pre>

<p>The created configuration file can be passed to the Ballerina program with <code>--b7a.config.file</code> option along with
the path of the configuration file.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ ballerina run hello_world_service.bal --b7a.config.file=&lt;path-to-conf&gt;/ballerina.conf

[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9797
ballerina: started Prometheus HTTP listener 0.0.0.0:9797
ballerina: started publishing tracers to Jaeger on localhost:5775
[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9090
</code></pre>

<p>Redirect the standard output to a file if you want to monitor logs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ nohup ballerina run hello_world_service.bal --b7a.config.file=&lt;path-to-conf&gt;/ballerina.conf &gt; ballerina.log &amp;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Send few requests.</p>
<p>Send few requests to <a href="http://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello">http://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello</a></p>
<p>Example cURL command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ curl http://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> View tracing and metrics in dashboard.</p>
<p>View the tracing information on Jaeger via <a href="http://localhost:16686/">http://localhost:16686/</a> and view metrics information from Grafana
dashboard on <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>.</p>
<p>Sample view of Jaeger dashboard for hello_world_service.bal is shown below. 
<img alt="Jaeger Sample Dashboard" src="../images/jaeger-sample-dashboard.png" title="Jaeger Sample Dashboard" /></p>
<p>Sample view of Grafana dashboard for hello_world_service.bal is shown below. 
<img alt="Grafana Sample Dashboard" src="../images/grafana-sample-hello-world-service-stats.png" title="Grafana HelloWorld Service Sample Dashboard" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Visualize the logs.</p>
<p>If you have configured log analytics, view the logs in Kibana via <a href="http://localhost:5601">http://localhost:5601</a></p>
<p><img alt="Kibana Sample Dashboard" src="../images/kibana-sample-dashboard.png" title="Kibana Sample Dashboard" /></p>
<h2 id="monitoring-metrics">Monitoring Metrics</h2>
<p>Metrics help to monitor the runtime behaviour of a service. Therefore, metrics is a vital part of monitoring
Ballerina services. However, metrics is not the same as analytics. For example, you should not use metrics to do
something like per-request billing. Metrics are used to measure what Ballerina service does at runtime to make
better decisions using the numbers. The code generates business value when it continuously run in production.
Therefore, it is imperative to continuously measure the code in production.</p>
<p>Metrics, by default, supports Prometheus. In order to support Prometheus, an HTTP endpoint starts with the context
of <code>/metrics</code> in default port 9797 when starting the Ballerina service.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-metrics-configuration-for-ballerina">Advanced Metrics Configuration for Ballerina</h3>
<p>This section focuses on the Ballerina configurations that are available for metrics monitoring with Prometheus,

<h3 id="setup-external-systems-for-metrics">Setup External Systems for Metrics</h3>
<p>There are mainly two systems involved in collecting and visualizing the metrics. <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> is used to collect the
metrics from the Ballerina service and <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> can connect to Prometheus and visualize the metrics in the dashboard.</p>
<h4 id="prometheus">Prometheus</h4>
<p><a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> is used as the monitoring system, which pulls out the metrics collected from the Ballerina service
'/metrics'. This section focuses on the quick installation of Prometheus with Docker, and configure it to collect 
metrics from Ballerina service with default configurations. Below provided steps needs to be followed to configure 
Prometheus. There are many other ways to install the Prometheus and you can find possible options from
<a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a <code>prometheus.yml</code> file in <code>/tmp/</code> directory.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the following content to <code>/tmp/prometheus.yml</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="yaml">global:
  scrape_interval:     15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['a.b.c.d:9797']
</code></pre>

<p>Here the targets <code>'a.b.c.d:9797'</code> should contain the host and port of the <code>/metrics</code> service that's exposed from 
Ballerina for metrics collection. Add the IP of the host in which the Ballerina service is running as <code>a.b.c.d</code> and its
port (default <code>9797</code>).
If you need more information refer <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/">official documentation of Prometheus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Start the Prometheus server in a Docker container with below command.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ docker run -p 19090:9090 -v /tmp/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to <a href="http://localhost:19090/">http://localhost:19090/</a> and check whether you can see the Prometheus graph.
Ballerina metrics should appear in Prometheus graph's metrics list when Ballerina service is started.</p>
<h4 id="grafana">Grafana</h4>
<p>Let’s use <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> to visualize metrics in a dashboard. For this, we need to install Grafana, and configure
Prometheus as a datasource. Follow the below provided steps and configure Grafana.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start Grafana as Docker container with below command.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
</code></pre>

<p>For more information refer <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana/">Grafana in Docker Hub</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a> to access the Grafana dashboard running on Docker.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Login to the dashboard with default user, username: <code>admin</code> and password: <code>admin</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add Prometheus as datasource with <code>Browser</code> access configuration as provided below.</p>
<p><img alt="Grafana Prometheus Datasource" src="../images/grafana-prometheus-datasource.png" title="Grafana Prometheus Datasource" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Import the Grafana dashboard designed to visualize Ballerina metrics from <a href="https://grafana.com/dashboards/5841">https://grafana.com/dashboards/5841</a>.
This dashboard consists of service and client invocation level metrics in near real-time view. </p>
<p>Ballerina HTTP Service Metrics Dashboard Panel will be as below.
<img alt="Ballerina Service Metrics" src="../images/grafana-ballerina-metrics-1.png" title="Ballerina Sample Service Metrics Dashboard" /></p>
<p>Ballerina HTTP Client Metrics Dashboard Panel will be as below.
<img alt="Ballerina Client Metrics" src="../images/grafana-ballerina-metrics-3.png" title="Ballerina Sample Client Metrics Dashboard" /></p>
<p>Ballerina SQL Client Metrics Dashboard Panel will be as below.

<h2 id="distributed-tracing">Distributed Tracing</h2>
<p>Tracing provides information regarding the roundtrip of a service invocation based on the concept of spans, which are
structured in a hierarchy based on the cause and effect concept. Tracers propagate across several services that can be
deployed in several nodes, depicting a high-level view of interconnections among services as well, hence coining the
term distributed tracing.</p>
<p>A span is a logical unit of work, which encapsulates a start and end time as well as metadata to give more meaning to
the unit of work being completed. For example, a span representing a client call to an HTTP endpoint would give the
user the latency of the client call and metadata like the HTTP URL being called and HTTP method used. If the span
represents an SQL client call, the metadata would include the query being executed.</p>
<p>Tracing gives the user a high-level view of how a single service invocation is processed across several distributed
microservices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify service bottlenecks - The user can monitor the latencies and identify when a service invocation slows down,
pinpoint where the slowing down happens (by looking at the span latencies) and take action to improve the latency.</li>
<li>Error identification - If an error occurs during the service invocation, it will show up in the list of tracers.
The user can easily identify where the error occurred and information of the error will be attached to the relevant
span as metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ballerina supports <a href="http://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a> standards by default. This means that Ballerina services
can be traced using OpenTracing implementations like <a href="http://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>, and
<a href="https://zipkin.io/">Zipkin</a>. Jaeger is the default tracer of Ballerina.</p>
<p>Semantic tags used by Ballerina also follow the <a href="https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/semantic_conventions.md">semantic conventions defined in OpenTracing
specification.</a></p>
<h3 id="advanced-tracing-configuration-for-ballerina">Advanced Tracing Configuration for Ballerina</h3>

<h3 id="setup-external-systems-for-tracing">Setup External Systems for Tracing</h3>
<p>Ballerina by default supports Jaerger and Zipkin for distributed tracing. This section focuses on configuring the
Jaeger and Zipkin with Dockers as a quick installation.</p>
<h4 id="jaeger-server">Jaeger Server</h4>
<p>Jaeger is the default distributed tracing system that is supported. There are many possible ways to deploy Jaeger and you can find more information on this <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/deployment/">link</a>. Here we focus on all in one deployment with Docker.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install Jaeger via Docker and start the Docker container by executing below command.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ docker run -d -p5775:5775/udp -p6831:6831/udp -p6832:6832/udp -p5778:5778 -p16686:16686 -p14268:14268 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <a href="http://localhost:16686">http://localhost:16686</a> and load the web UI of the Jaeger to make sure it is functioning properly.</p>
<p>The below image is the sample tracing information you can see from Jaeger.</p>
<p><img alt="Jaeger Tracing Dashboard" src="../images/jaeger-tracing-dashboard.png" title="Jaeger Tracing Dashboard" /></p>
<h4 id="zipkin-server">Zipkin Server</h4>
<p>Similar to Jaeger, Zipkin is another distributed tracing system that is supported by the Ballerina. There are many
different configurations and deployment exist for Zipkin, please go to <a href="https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin">link</a>
for more information. Here we focus on all in one deployment with Docker.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install Zipkin via Docker and start the Docker container by executing following command.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <a href="http://localhost:9411/zipkin/">http://localhost:9411/zipkin/</a> and load the web UI of the Zipkin to make sure it is functioning
properly. The below shown is the sample Zipkin dashboard for the hello world sample in the <a href="#Quick-start">Quick Start</a></p>
<p><img alt="Zipkin Sample" src="../images/zipkin-sample.png" title="Zipkin Sample" /></p>
<h2 id="distributed-logging">Distributed Logging</h2>
<p>Ballerina distributed logging and analysis is supported by Elastic Stack. Ballerina has a log module for logging in to 
the console. In order to monitor the logs, the Ballerina standard output needs to be redirected to a file.</p>
<p>This can be done by running the Ballerina service as below.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ nohup ballerina run hello_world_service.bal &gt; ballerina.log &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>You can view the logs with below command.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ tail -f ~/wso2-ballerina/workspace/ballerina.log
</code></pre>

<h3 id="setup-external-systems-for-log-analytics">Setup External Systems for Log Analytics</h3>
<h4 id="elastic-stack">Elastic Stack</h4>
<p>The elastic stack comprises of the following components.</p>
<ol>
<li>Beats - Multiple agents that ship data to Logstash or Elasticsearch. In our context, Filebeat will ship the Ballerina logs to Logstash. Filebeat should be a container running on the same host as the Ballerina service. This is so that the log file (ballerina.log) can be mounted to the Filebeat container.</li>
<li>Logstash - Used to process and structure the log files received from Filebeat and send to Elasticsearch.</li>
<li>Elasticsearch - Storage and indexing of the logs received by Logstash.</li>
<li>Kibana - Visualizes the data stored in Elasticsearch</li>
</ol>
<p>Elasticsearch and Kibana are provided as <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud">Cloud Services</a>
Alternatively, Docker containers can be used to set up Elasticsearch and Kibana as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Docker images using the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="bash"># Elasticsearch Image
$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.5.1
# Kibana Image
$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:6.5.1
# Filebeat Image
$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:6.5.1
# Logstash Image
$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:6.5.1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start Elasticsearch and Kibana containers by executing the following commands.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -it -h elasticsearch --name elasticsearch docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.5.1
$ docker run -p 5601:5601 -h kibana --name kibana --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:6.5.1
</code></pre>

<p>If you run on Linux you may have to increase the <code>vm.max_map_count</code> for the Elasticsearch container to start. 
Execute the following command to do that.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create a <code>logstash.conf</code> file in the <code>/tmp/pipeline/</code> directory and include the following content in the file.</p>
<pre><code>input {
  beats {
    port =&gt; 5044
    }
}
filter {
  grok  {
    match =&gt; { &quot;message&quot; =&gt; &quot;%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:date}%{SPACE}%{WORD:logLevel}%{SPACE}\[%{GREEDYDATA:module}\]%{SPACE}\-%{SPACE}%{GREEDYDATA:logMessage}&quot;}
  }
}
output {
    elasticsearch {
        hosts =&gt; &quot;elasticsearch:9200&quot;
        index =&gt; &quot;ballerina&quot;
      document_type =&gt; &quot;ballerina_logs&quot;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here the 3 stages are specified in the pipeline. Input is specified as beats and listens to port 5044. 
A grok filter is used to structure the Ballerina logs and the output is specified to push to Elasticsearch on
<code>elasticsearch:9200</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Start the Logstash container by the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ docker run -h logstash --name logstash --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch -it --rm -v /tmp/pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/ -p 5044:5044 docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:6.5.1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Configure Filebeat to ship the Ballerina logs. Create a <code>filebeat.yml</code> file in the <code>/tmp/</code> directory and include the following content in the file.</p>
<pre><code>filebeat.prospectors:
- type: log
  paths:
    - /usr/share/filebeat/ballerina.log
output.logstash:
  hosts: [&quot;logstash:5044&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Start the Filebeat container with the following command.</p>
<p>The <code>-v</code> flag is used for bind mounting, where the container will read the file from the host machine. Provide the path to the ballerina.log file, to be bind mounted to the filebeat container.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ docker run -v /tmp/filebeat.yml:/usr/share/filebeat/filebeat.yml -v /&lt;path-to-ballerina.log&gt;/ballerina.log:/usr/share/filebeat/ballerina.log --link logstash:logstash docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:6.5.1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Access Kibana to visualize the logs at <a href="http://localhost:5601">http://localhost:5601</a>. Add an index named <code>ballerina</code> and click on <code>Discover</code> to visualize the logs.</p>
